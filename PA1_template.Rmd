## Loading and preprocessing the data

I unzip the file into the working directory. I read the data in and assign it as "act".

```{r gettingthedata, echo=TRUE}
 unzip("activity.zip")
 act <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

I summarize the data to check for NA values and clean them.

```{r summary, echo=TRUE}
summary(act)
act <- na.omit(act)
summary(act)
```
